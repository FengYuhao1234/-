Although  both\nMEASUR (Methods for Eliciting, Analyzing and Specifying\nUser’s  Requirement)  and  RUP  (Rational  Unified  Process)\nprovide theirownBusiness Modeling Method (BMM), each\nhas  obvious  merits  and  demerits.  To  keep  the  merits  and\navoid   the   demerits   at   the   same   time,   in   this   paper,   a\nMEASUR and RUP combined BMM is devised based on the\ncomparison   ofthe   twoBMMsrespectivelyfromthe\nsemantics,   pragmatics   and   social   world   of   the   semiotic\nframework.The method proposed consists of three activities\nin  sequence.Unified  Modeling  Language  (UML)Use  Case\nDiagrams  (UCD)  are  employed  in  the  first  activity  “UML\nUCD  Modeling”  to  modelbusinessfunctionsconcerning\nwiththe  social  world  since  they  are  the  only  formal  result\nmodeling  business  functions  in  both  BMMs.Theextended\nUML  Activity  Diagrams(AD)  are  employed  in  the  second\nactivity   “Extended  UML   AD   Modeling”   to   model   both\nnorms and communications concerning with both the social\nworld   and   the   pragmatics   sinceUML   AD   can   model\ncommunications  directly  and  obviouslybut  norms  cannot\nandthereforemaketheanalysisofpurposesin\ncommunications   much  easier.In  addition,it   is  easy   to\nextend  UML  AD with  the  deontic  operators  to  express  the\nsame  meaning  as  norms  following  the  simple  rules.The\nOntology  Charts  (OC)  are  employed  in  the  third  activity\n“OC Modeling”  to define  meanings  of terminology  used in\nbusiness  models  and  concerning  with  the  semantics  since\nontological dependencies are modeled directly and clearly in\nOC but not defined in UML Class Diagrams.\nIndex  Terms—MEASUR,  RUP,UML,business  modeling,\nsemiotic framework,information systems\nI.INTRODUCTION\nIt  has  been  widely  accepted  by  current  Information\nSystems (IS)  researchers that  IS are  social-technological\nsystems. That is to say, to develop aninformation system\nsuccessfully,   first   ofall,   developers   have   to   fully\nunderstand the business in which the information system\nworks. Therefore, business modeling has been a primary\ntask in the IS development lifecycle.\nAstwo  kinds  ofIS  development  methods,  although\nboth  MEASUR(Methods  forEliciting,Analyzing  and\nSpecifyingUser’s   Requirement)   and   RUP   (Rational\nUnified  Process)  provide  their  own  Business  Modeling\nMethod  (BMM),  each  has  obvious  merits  anddemerits.\nIn order to keep the merits and avoid thedemerits at the\nsame  time,someresearchershave  correlatedthe  two\nBMMs.   In   [1],   Zhiwu   Xie   et   al.   pointed   out   that\nOntological Dependencies (OD) in Ontology Charts (OC)\nderived from MEASURcan be modeled as either nested\nclasses  or  inheritances  inUnified  Modeling  Language\n(UML)Class Diagrams (CD) andagents’ normsderived\nfrom  MEASURforactionson  business  terms  can  be\nmodeledinUML  Activity  Diagrams  (AD).  In  [2-3],\ncontinuing the effort in [1], RodrigoBonacinandYasser\nAdeset al. provided rules for transferring OC into UML\nCD  respectively.  However,until  now,no  research  has\nbeen done tocomparethe two BMMsrespectivelyfrom\nthesemantics,   pragmatics   and   social   world   of   the\nsemiotic  framework  and  devisea  MEASUR  and  RUP\ncombined BMM,  which keeps the  merits and avoids the\ndemerits of the two BMMs at the same time.\nThis paper  is organizedasfollows:in section 2,both\nthe   semiotic    framework   and   the   two   BMMs   are\nintroduced.  In  section  3,thecomparisonofthe  two\nBMMs  are  presented.  In  section  4,  the  MEASUR  and\nRUP  combined  BMM  is  devised.Finally,in  section  5,\nconclusions are provieded.\nII.THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND\nA.The SemioticFramework\nTraditionally,the   division   of   semiotics   has   been\nsyntactics, semanticsand pragmatics. Stamperhas added\nthe  other  three,  whichare  physical  world,empirics  and\nsocialworld,   and   proposed   the   semiotic   framework\nillustrated in figure 1.Since thefocus of this paper is on\nbusiness  modeling,only  the  semantics,  pragmatics  and\nthesocialworldareintroducedbelow.\n[4]\nCorresponding author: Hui Du.\n1086JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 2011\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\ndoi:10.4304/jcp.6.6.1086-1093\n\nFigure 1. Thesemiotic framework\nSemanticsor    Meaningof    a    sign    is    normally\nconsidered  as a  relationship  between a  sign andwhatit\nrefers to.This is referential meaning and a logic function\nmapping  words  to  reality.  But  in  most  social  affairs,\nmeaning   is   more   appropriately   seen   as   relationship\nbetween  a  sign  and  the  response  the  sign  elicits  in  a\ngiven  social  setting.This  iswhatStamper  calls  the\nbehaviormeaning.At   the   semantic   level   of   use   of\nlanguage,  what  is  firstly  reflected  in  a  sentence  is  the\nmeaningwhichisaccommodated  by  propositions.  The\nsentence  can  be  examined  for  its  validity,  signification\nand correspondence to the business world.\n[4]\nWhen   a   sign   has   a   meaning,   it   can   be   used\nintentionally   forcommunications,   conversationsand\nnegotiations. Pragmatics, in such a case of the purposeful\nuse of signs, is a branch of semiotics concerned with the\nrelationship betweenan intentional use of asign and the\nresultingbehavior   ofresponsibleagentsin   a   social\ncontext.In   a   process   of   verbal   communication,   the\npurpose of the conversation is set up by the speakerand\nthe speakercan conduct a series of speech acts to pursue\nthe  purpose  which  may  be  clearly  stated  by  her/himor\nhidden.\n[4][5][6]\nWhen a conversation takes place between two or more\npeople,   a   changeat   social   level   will   be   caused.   A\nconversation can be seen as a proper chain of speech acts.\nAs soon asaspeech act is addressed to the addressee, an\nobligation is usually built up for the addresseeto respond.\nOtherwise,  the  addressee  might  not  feel  at  ease.In  a\nsocial   setting,   normsincludingbeliefs,   expectations,\ncommitments, contracts, law and culturegovern people’s\nbehaviorsand determine whether they are acceptable.In\naddition, if a technicalinformation systemis to serve the\norganization   well,itis   crucialto   understand   the\norganizational functions at the social level.\n[4]\nB.The BMM provided byMEASUR\nProposed  in  the  later  1970s,  MEASUR  is  a  radically\nset  ofnormorientedmethods  forISdevelopment.  To\nmodel    business,    MEASUR    providestwoprimary\nmethods:Semantic  Analysis  Method(SAM)and  Norm\nAnalysis Method(NAM).\n[4][7][8]\nOCarefinalresult  ofSAM.Fundamental  concepts\nemployed  by  OC  include  agent,  affordance,ontological\ndependency,determiner,    role,    generic-specific    and\nwhole-part.\nAn agentcan be as simple as anindividualperson and\ncomplex  as  a  cultural  group,  language  community  or\nsociety.An   affordanceis   abehavioran   agent   can\nperform in its environment.OD areused to indicate that\nsomeagents oraffordances(Dependants)can be possible\nonly if certain otheragents oraffordances(Antecedents)\nareavailable.Properties  of  agents  and  affordances  are\nlabeled  as  determiners.  When  an  agent  is  involved  in  a\nbehavior,  it   may  have  a  role  to  play.The  generics\nrepresent  patterns  of  behavioror  mechanisms,  whose\nparticular  realizations  orinstances  are  the  specifics.  A\ncompositeagent   oraffordance(the   whole)can   be\npartitioned into several parts (the part).\nWhen   modeling   an   ontology   chart,   a   society   is\nnormally defined as the root agent, on which other agents\nand  affordances  are  ontologically depended.Agents  are\nplaced in ovals.Affordances are put in rectangular boxes.\nLinesbetween   agentsandaffordances   indicate   OD.\nAntecedents   are   placed   on   the   left   of   dependants.\nDeterminers are  placed  behind  “#”.  Role names are  put\nin half-curves.The specific are placed under the generic.\nA  line  with  a  dot  indicates  the  whole-part  relationship.\nFor   example,   figure   2shows   the   ontological   chart\nillustratinga project managementbusinessas follows:\nInanorganization,  departmentsare  responsible  for\nprojects. Each department and each project has a budget.\nEmployees  workingin  one  departmentcan  be  assigned\nto  different  projects.  Work  activities  are  charged  at  an\nhourly   rate   which   depends   on   the   function   of   the\nemployee.The total time which an employee spends on a\nprojecttask is imputed at the hourly rate.\n[4]\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 20111087\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nFigure 2.The OCdescribinga project managementbusiness\nNorms  arefinalresult  ofNAM.Wright  explains  the\nconcept  of  a  norm  in  this  way:“‘Norm’  has  several\npartial   synonyms   which  are   good   English.   ‘Pattern’,\n‘standard’ and ‘type’ are such words. So are ‘regulation’,\n‘rule’  and  ‘law’”\n[9]\n.Norms  are  developed  through  the\npractical  experiences  of  people  in  a  culture  and  in  turn\nhave functionsof directing, coordinating and controlling\nactions  within  the  culture.In  business,  most  rules  and\nregulations  fall  into  the  category  of  behavioral  norms.\nThesenorms prescribe what people must, may and must\nnot  do,  which  are  equivalent  to  three  deontic  operators\n‘permitted’,  ‘prohibited’  and‘obliged’.  The  following\nformat    is    suitable    for    specification   of   behavioral\nnorms:\n[4][7][8]\nwhenever<condition>\nif<state>\nthen<an agent>\nis<“permitted”/“prohibited”/“obliged”>\nto do<action>\nFollowingtheformat,a credit card company may state\na normgoverning interest charges as follows:\n[4]\nwheneveran amount of outstanding credit\nifmore than 25 days after posting\nthenthe card holder\nisobliged\ntopay the interest\nThe  norm  says  that  after  25  days  of  posting  the\ninvoice, if there is still an amount of outstanding credit,\nthe card holder will have to pay the interest.\nC.The BMM provided by RUP\nProposed  in the  later  1990s,  RUP,  an objectoriented\nsoftware    engineering    process,hasbeen    gradually\naccepted by ISindustryand is widely used bycurrentIS\ndevelopers.In  RUP,agoodbusiness  modelconsists  of\ntwo   major   parts:abusiness   use-case   model   anda\nbusiness object model.\n[10][11][12]\nAbusiness  use-case  modelincludesUML  UseCase\nDiagrams(UCD)containingbusiness  use  cases,  which\ndescribebusiness  processesillustrated  assequencesof\nactions   that   provide   observable   value(functions)to\nbusiness  actors.To   fully  understand   thevalueof  a\nbusinessuse  case,developersmust  know  whomthe\nbusinessuse   caseinteracts   with.Different   types   of\n“interactors”arerepresented  asbusinessactors.\n[10]\nFor\nexample,  in  figure  3,  the  business  use  case  “Individual\nCheck-in” interacts with the business actor “Passenger”.\nFigure 3.TheUMLuse case diagram\nUML AD are recommended to illustrate sequences of\nactions involved in business use cases in detail. In UML\nAD,  an  activity  staterepresents  the  performance  of  an\nactivity  within  the  process.A  swim  laneindicates  who\nperforms  a  given  activity.A  transition  shows  what  one\nactivity  state  follows  another.  A  decision  with  a  set  of\nguard conditions are defined  to control which transition\nfollows  once  anactivity  is  complete.\n[10]\nFor  example,\nfigure 4 shows the UML activity diagram illustrating the\ngeneralsequence of the actionsinvolved in the business\nuse case “Individual Check-in” in detail.\nFigure 4.The UML activity diagram\n1088JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 2011\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nWhereas   a   business   use-case   model   focuses   on\nsequences  of  actions  involved  in  business  processes,  a\nbusiness   object   model   focusesonbusinessactors,\nbusinessworkers   and   business   entitiesinvolved   in\nbusiness  processesandtheir  relationships.A  business\nworker  represents  a  role  in  abusiness,  which  interacts\nwithbusiness   actors,other   business    workers   and\nmanipulatesbusinessentities.Abusinessentity\nrepresentsasignificantandpersistentpieceof\ninformation  that  is  manipulated  by  business  actors  and\nbusiness  workers.\n[10]\nFor  example,  figure5showsthe\nUMLclass   diagram   illustratingthebusiness   actor\n“Passenger”,thebusiness  worker“Check-in  agent”and\nthebusinessentity“Ticket”,  “Baggage”  and  “Boarding\ncard”involved   in   the   business   use   case   “individual\nCheck-in” and their relationships.\nFigure 5.The UML class diagram\nTomodel  UML  UCD,  UML  AD  and  UML  Class\nDiagrams (CD), corresponding methodscan be found in\n[11-12], which are specified in detail.\nIII.COMPARISONOFTHE TWOBMMS\nPrior  to  the  comparison,  the  relationship  of  the  two\nBMMshave tobe firstly identified.\nAccording  to  the  previous  introduction  of  OC  and\nUML CD, it is quite apparent that both of them are used\nmainly   to   define   meanings   of   terminology   used   in\nbusiness  models.  Therefore,  from view of the  semiotics\nframework, both of themconcern withthe semantics of\nthe framework.\nAlthough purposes incommunications are difficult to\nmodel  by  formal  means,  their  underlying  mechanisms\ncan be understood by studying social and cultural norms\nat   the   social   level.\n[4]\nTherefore,from   view   of   the\nsemiotics   framework,norms   are   the   formal   results\nconcerningwithboththepragmatics andthesocial world\noftheframework.Likewise,purposesin\ncommunications are not modeledformallyand obviously\ninUML  ADeither.  However,  communicationsbetween\nbusiness actors and  business  workersareobviouslyand\nformallyrepresentedinthem, which make theanalysis of\npurposesmuch easier.Moreover,although norms arenot\nspecified   in   UML   AD,business   rules,\n[13]\nwhich   are\nsimilar to norms andgenerallystate that if conditions are\nmet, certain events will happen or actions willbe taken,\nare  hidden  behind  them.For  example,  following  the\nstructure employed in [13],in figure 4,the business rule\nhidden behind the transition pointing to the activity state\n“Deposit baggage” can be explicitly expressed as follows:\niftheticket\niscorrect\nthendeposit baggage\nTo  sum  up,fromview  of  the  semiotics  framework,\nUML  ADconcern  withboththe  pragmatics  andthe\nsocial worldof the framework.\nAt  last,  since  business  use  casesprovide  observable\nvalue  (functions)  tobusiness  actors,according  to  the\nprevious introduction of the social world of the semiotics\nframework, UML UCDconcernwiththe social worldof\nthe framework too.\nTable 1 summarizes the relationship of the two BMMs\nfrom the semiotic framework view.\nTABLE I.\nTHERELATIONSHIPOF THE TWOBMMS\nMEASURRUP\nFormal\nresults\nMethods\nused\nFormal\nresults\nMethodsused\nThe\nsemantics\nOCSAMUML CDUMLCD\nmodeling\nmethod\nThe\npragmatics\nUML ADUMLAD\nmodeling\nmethod\nThe    social\nworld\nNormsNAM\nUML   AD\nandUML\nUCD\nUML   AD   and\nUMLUCD\nmodeling\nmethod\nBased   on   table   1,   thetwoBMMs   can   then   be\ncompared.  Here,  the  comparison  focus  is  on  theformal\nresultsof  the  two  BMMsrespectively  in  semantics,\npragmatics and social world of the semiotic framework.\nThe purpose of the comparison is to find obvious merits\nanddemerits  each  of  the  formal  results  has.

On  the\ncontrary,for  both  OC  and  norms,  it  is  theirobvious\ndemeritsthat  theyareemployedat  presentonlybya\nsmall group of peopleandno commercial effort has been\nmade to popularize them yet.Moreover,atthesemantics\nlevel, as animportant and indispensable relationship, OD\nare modeled directlyand clearlyin OCbutnot defined in\nUML  CD.\n[1-3]\nAtthepragmaticslevel,three  deontic\noperators are specified in norms but not defined in UML\nAD,  which  makethe  presentations  of  communications\nandthe  analysis  of  purposes  in  communications  more\nprecise.On   the   other   side,UML   AD   can   model\ncommunicationsdirectly and obviouslybut norms cannot,\nwhich make the analysis ofpurposes in communications\nmuch  easier.At  last,  it  is  their  commondemeritthat\npurposes in communications cannot be modeled formally\nand obviouslyin both of them.Atthesocial worldlevel,\nsimilarly,three deontic operatorsare specified in norms.\nHowever, in UML AD,business rules rather than norms\nare specifiedindirectly.As stated in [13]: “with the help\nof the deontic operators, norms can handle both business\nrulesandexceptions,  which  are  situations  difficult  to\nanticipate  and  specify  in  advance  and  are  situations,\nwhere decisions occur on an ad hoc basis and are made\nsolely   on   human   judgment”.In   addition,business\nfunctionscan  bemodeled  by  UML  UCD  but  norms\ncannot.\nIV.AMEASURANDRUPCOMBINEDBMM\nAs  discussedabove,  since  both  thetwoBMMs  have\nobvious   merits   anddemerits,it   is   supposed   thata\nMEASUR and  RUPcombined  BMMmaybe  devisedin\norderto  keep  the  merits  and  avoid  thedemerits  at  the\nsame time.\nKecheng Liu states:“To model an information system\nis  to  represent,  by  formal  means,  an  organization  in\nwhich  people  use  signs  for  business  purposes.

Issues at the three semiotic\nlevels are closely related.The social concern determines\nthe intentions that the speaker needs to express and thus\ndecide the words and expressions to be uttered.”\n[4]\n.\nBased   onthe   statement   aboveandtheprevious\ncomparison,a  MEASUR  and  RUP  combined  BMM  is\ndevised and shown in figure6.\nFigure6.TheMEASURand RUPcombined BMM\nIn figure 6,theformal result of thefirstactivity “UML\nUCDModeling”   isUML   UCDtomodel   functions\nprovided  by  a  business,  whichconcernwiththe  social\nworld.Theformal    result    of    the    secondactivity\n“ExtendedUML ADModeling” isextendedUML ADto\nmodelbothnormsandcommunications, whichtherefore\nconcern withboththe social world andthe pragmaticsat\nthe same time.Theformal result of the thirdactivity “OC\nModeling”is  OCtodefinemeanings  of  terminology\nused   in   business   models,   whichconcern   withthe\nsemantics.\nThe reason to chooseUML UCDas the formal result\nof the first activityisthatthey arethe only formal result\nmodelingbusiness  functionsasshown  in  table  2.Since\nthe BMM provided by RUP is widely usedby current IS\ndevelopers, theUML UCDmodeling methodwill not be\npresented here. People interested initcould find help in\n[11-12].\nAs   pointed   out   previously,   UML   AD   can   model\ncommunications directlyand obviously but norms cannot,\nwhich make the analysis of purposes in communications\nmuch easier. In addition,bothUML UCD andUML AD\nare business models employed by the BMM providedby\nRUP,   whichhas  the  similar  modelingactivitiesand\nsequenceas thedevised BMMandismuchwidely used\nthan the BMM provided by MEASUR.At last, although\nbusiness rules rather than norms are specified indirectly\nin  UML  AD,it  is  easy  to  extendUML  ADwith  the\ndeontic operatorstoexpress the same meaningsas norms\nfollowingthesimplerulesspecifiedbelow:\nFirstly,  each  transition  pointing  to  an  activity  state\nshould   be   extended   with   one   of   the   three   deontic\noperators.\nSecondly,when the “permitted” or the “prohibited” is\nused,  the  text  “permitted”  or  the  text  “prohibited”  must\nappear  at  the  end  oftheguard  condition  and  separated\nwith the guard condition by “/”.\nThirdly,when the “obliged” is used, the text “obliged”\ncan be omitted. Otherwise, it should appear at the same\nplaceas the text “permitted” andthe text “prohibited”.\nTo specify the usageoftherulesabove,takefigure4\nas an example.By following the rules, figure7shows the\nUMLactivity diagramextended.\n1090JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 2011\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nFigure7. The UML activity diagramextended\nAs  shown  in  figure  7,all  transitions  pointing  toan\nactivity  state  have  been  extended  with  the  “obliged”  or\nthe“permitted” except the two transitions pointing to the\nactivities  “Print  boardingcard”  and  “Receive  boarding\ncard”respectively.In  fact,  thetwotransitions  areboth\nextended with the “obliged”. However, according to the\nthird rule, the text “obliged” hasbeen omitted.\nMoreover,  following  theformatfor  specification  of\nbehavioral normspreviously introduced,the norm hidden\nbehind   the   transition   pointing   to   the   activity   state\n“Informpreferences”   can   be   explicitly   expressed   as\nfollows:\nwheneverantickethas beenchecked\nifthe ticketiscorrect\nthenthepassenger\nisobliged\ntoinformpreferences\nInaddition,the  norm  hidden  behind  the  transition\npointing  to  the  activity  state  “Deposit  baggage”can  be\nexplicitly expressedas follows:\nwheneverantickethasbeenchecked\nifthe ticket is correct\nthenthe passenger\nispermitted\ntodeposit baggage\nFurthermore,  theusagesof  the“obliged”  and  the\n“permitted”respectivelyin  two  normsalsovalidatethe\nstatement  previously  cited  that:  “with  the  help  of  the\ndeontic operators, norms can handle both business rules\nandexceptions.”\n[13]\nHere,   the   first   norm   handlesa\nbusiness  rule,  which  canalsobe  handled  by  UML  AD\nwithout  the“obliged”extension.  However,  the  second\nnorm handles anexception, which cannot be handled by\nUML AD withoutthe “permitted”extension.\nBecause of the same reason as UMLUCD, theUML\nADmodeling methodwill not be presented here. People\ninterested in it could also find help in [11-12].\nFor  the  sakes  above,theextended  UML  ADare\nchosenas the formal result of the second activity.\nAs  shown  in  table  2,  OD  are  modeled  directly  and\nclearly  in  OC  but  not  defined  in  UML  CD.  Although\nefforts have been devoted into transferring OC into UML\nCD,\n[1-3]\nno simple and mature method has been proposed.\nIn all of the efforts, the transformation of OD hasalways\nbeen the most difficultissue.Therefore, although OC are\nnarrowly   used,in   order   to   keep   theprecise   and\ncompleteness ofbusiness modelsatthe semantics level,\nOCarechosenas the formal result of the third activity.\nReference[4] providesa detailed description of SAM,\nwhich includesfourprimaryphasesto produceOC.The\nfirst phase“problem definition”is for people involved to\nreceivewrittendocuments  to  understand  thebusiness\nproblem.Thenextphase,“candidateaffordance\ngeneration”,   is   to   produce   a   list   of   vocabulary   of\nsemantic  units  that  may  possibly  be  used  inOCto\ndescribe  agents  and  their  patterns  of  behavior.In  the\nfollowingphase “candidate grouping”, the semantic units\narecategorized as agents, affordances, determiners, role\nnames,  and  so  on.  Dependantsareconnected  to  their\nantecedents.Sketches of piecemeal ontological structures\nare   conceived.   Finally,   there   is   “ontology  charting”,\nwhere   a   complete   ontology   chart   isproducedby\nassembling the ontological structures.\n[4]\nFollowingSAMto  complete  the  thirdactivity“OC\nModeling”,extended UML ADderived from the second\nactivity“Extended UML AD Modeling”should be taken\nasadditionalwritten   documents   in   the   first   phase\n“problem  definition”.In  the  second  phase  “candidate\naffordance  generation”,nounsand  verbsused  to  name\nswim lanes and activity statesoftheextended UML AD\ncouldbe considered assemantic units.In the third phase\n“candidate  grouping”,  nouns  used  to  name  swim  lanes\ncould be categorized as agents.Nouns and verbs used to\nname activity states could be categorized as affordances.\nAt last, theperformancesequence of activity statescould\nbe used to determine OD.\nTo  specify  the  practice  of  thestatementabove,  take\nfigure 7 asthe onlywritten document,thesemantic units\nidentifiedshouldinclude“Passenger”, “Check-in Agent”,\n“Show”,    “ticket”,    “Check”,    “Deposit”,    “baggage”,\n“Handle”,   “Inform”,   “preferences”,   “Send”,   “airport\ntravel agency”,  “Print”,“boardingcard”and  “Receive”.\nAt last,theontology chartderivedis shown infigure 8.\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 20111091\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nFigure 8. Theontology chart derived\nAs  shown  in  figure  8,“Passenger”  and  “Check-in\nAgent” as the names of the two swim lanes respectively\nare categorized as agents.Except “airport travel agency”,\nwhich is more appropriate to be categorized as an agent\naccording  to  the  previous  definition  of  agent,  all  nouns\nand  verbs  used  to  nametheactivity  states,  such  as\n“Show”,  “ticket”  and  “Check”  etc.,arecategorized  as\naffordances.At  last,  allthe  OD  are  consistent  with  the\nperformancesequence of the  activity states,  such as the\none  between  the  affordance  “Show”  and  the  affordance\n“Check”, which illustrates that the behavior “Check” can\noccuronly ifthe behavior “Show”has occurred.\nV.CONCLUSIONS\nBusiness   modeling   isa   primary   taskintheIS\ndevelopment  lifecycle.Although  both  MEASUR  and\nRUPprovide  their  own BMM,  eachhas obviousmerits\nanddemerits.To keep the merits and avoid thedemerits\nat  the  same  time,  in  this  paper,aMEASUR  and  RUP\ncombined  BMM  is devised  based  on the  comparison of\nthe    two    BMMsrespectivelyfromthesemantics,\npragmatics and social world of the semioticframework.\nJustlikeanyBMMs, the BMM devised in this paper\nhas alsodemerits.  Firstly,as  the  same  with both  norms\nand  UML  AD,purposes  in  communicationsare  not\nmodeledformally  and  obviouslyinthe  extended  UML\nADeither.  Secondly,sinceSAM  iscurrentlyusedby\nonly a small group ofISdevelopers, otherISdevelopers\nhave to study SAM beforetheyadoptthe BMMdevised.\nAt last, to validate the BMMdevised,more practices are\nabsolutelyindispensable.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work wassponsored bytheBeijing Philosophy and\nSocial Science Research Center for Beijing\nTransportation Developmentandthe Scientific Research\nFoundation for the ReturnedOverseas Chinese Scholars,\nState Education Ministry.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Z.Xie,  K.Liu,andD.Emmitt,“Improving  Business\nModelling  with  Organisational  Semiotics,”InDynamics\nand Change in Organizations-Studies in Organizational\nSemiotics,  H.W.M.Gazendam,  R.J.Jorna,andR.S.\nCijsonw, Eds.

Although  both\nMEASUR (Methods for Eliciting, Analyzing and Specifying\nUser’s  Requirement)  and  RUP  (Rational  Unified  Process)\nprovide theirownBusiness Modeling Method (BMM), each\nhas  obvious  merits  and  demerits.  To  keep  the  merits  and\navoid   the   demerits   at   the   same   time,   in   this   paper,   a\nMEASUR and RUP combined BMM is devised based on the\ncomparison   ofthe   twoBMMsrespectivelyfromthe\nsemantics,   pragmatics   and   social   world   of   the   semiotic\nframework.The method proposed consists of three activities\nin  sequence.Unified  Modeling  Language  (UML)Use  Case\nDiagrams  (UCD)  are  employed  in  the  first  activity  “UML\nUCD  Modeling”  to  modelbusinessfunctionsconcerning\nwiththe  social  world  since  they  are  the  only  formal  result\nmodeling  business  functions  in  both  BMMs.Theextended\nUML  Activity  Diagrams(AD)  are  employed  in  the  second\nactivity   “Extended  UML   AD   Modeling”   to   model   both\nnorms and communications concerning with both the social\nworld   and   the   pragmatics   sinceUML   AD   can   model\ncommunications  directly  and  obviouslybut  norms  cannot\nandthereforemaketheanalysisofpurposesin\ncommunications   much  easier.In  addition,it   is  easy   to\nextend  UML  AD with  the  deontic  operators  to  express  the\nsame  meaning  as  norms  following  the  simple  rules.The\nOntology  Charts  (OC)  are  employed  in  the  third  activity\n“OC Modeling”  to define  meanings  of terminology  used in\nbusiness  models  and  concerning  with  the  semantics  since\nontological dependencies are modeled directly and clearly in\nOC but not defined in UML Class Diagrams.\nIndex  Terms—MEASUR,  RUP,UML,business  modeling,\nsemiotic framework,information systems\nI.INTRODUCTION\nIt  has  been  widely  accepted  by  current  Information\nSystems (IS)  researchers that  IS are  social-technological\nsystems. That is to say, to develop aninformation system\nsuccessfully,   first   ofall,   developers   have   to   fully\nunderstand the business in which the information system\nworks. Therefore, business modeling has been a primary\ntask in the IS development lifecycle.\nAstwo  kinds  ofIS  development  methods,  although\nboth  MEASUR(Methods  forEliciting,Analyzing  and\nSpecifyingUser’s   Requirement)   and   RUP   (Rational\nUnified  Process)  provide  their  own  Business  Modeling\nMethod  (BMM),  each  has  obvious  merits  anddemerits.\nIn order to keep the merits and avoid thedemerits at the\nsame  time,someresearchershave  correlatedthe  two\nBMMs.   In   [1],   Zhiwu   Xie   et   al.   pointed   out   that\nOntological Dependencies (OD) in Ontology Charts (OC)\nderived from MEASURcan be modeled as either nested\nclasses  or  inheritances  inUnified  Modeling  Language\n(UML)Class Diagrams (CD) andagents’ normsderived\nfrom  MEASURforactionson  business  terms  can  be\nmodeledinUML  Activity  Diagrams  (AD).  In  [2-3],\ncontinuing the effort in [1], RodrigoBonacinandYasser\nAdeset al. provided rules for transferring OC into UML\nCD  respectively.  However,until  now,no  research  has\nbeen done tocomparethe two BMMsrespectivelyfrom\nthesemantics,   pragmatics   and   social   world   of   the\nsemiotic  framework  and  devisea  MEASUR  and  RUP\ncombined BMM,  which keeps the  merits and avoids the\ndemerits of the two BMMs at the same time.\nThis paper  is organizedasfollows:in section 2,both\nthe   semiotic    framework   and   the   two   BMMs   are\nintroduced.  In  section  3,thecomparisonofthe  two\nBMMs  are  presented.  In  section  4,  the  MEASUR  and\nRUP  combined  BMM  is  devised.Finally,in  section  5,\nconclusions are provieded.\nII.THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND\nA.The SemioticFramework\nTraditionally,the   division   of   semiotics   has   been\nsyntactics, semanticsand pragmatics. Stamperhas added\nthe  other  three,  whichare  physical  world,empirics  and\nsocialworld,   and   proposed   the   semiotic   framework\nillustrated in figure 1.Since thefocus of this paper is on\nbusiness  modeling,only  the  semantics,  pragmatics  and\nthesocialworldareintroducedbelow.\n[4]\nCorresponding author: Hui Du.\n1086JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 2011\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\ndoi:10.4304/jcp.6.6.1086-1093\n\nFigure 1. Thesemiotic framework\nSemanticsor    Meaningof    a    sign    is    normally\nconsidered  as a  relationship  between a  sign andwhatit\nrefers to.This is referential meaning and a logic function\nmapping  words  to  reality.  But  in  most  social  affairs,\nmeaning   is   more   appropriately   seen   as   relationship\nbetween  a  sign  and  the  response  the  sign  elicits  in  a\ngiven  social  setting.This  iswhatStamper  calls  the\nbehaviormeaning.At   the   semantic   level   of   use   of\nlanguage,  what  is  firstly  reflected  in  a  sentence  is  the\nmeaningwhichisaccommodated  by  propositions.  The\nsentence  can  be  examined  for  its  validity,  signification\nand correspondence to the business world.\n[4]\nWhen   a   sign   has   a   meaning,   it   can   be   used\nintentionally   forcommunications,   conversationsand\nnegotiations. Pragmatics, in such a case of the purposeful\nuse of signs, is a branch of semiotics concerned with the\nrelationship betweenan intentional use of asign and the\nresultingbehavior   ofresponsibleagentsin   a   social\ncontext.In   a   process   of   verbal   communication,   the\npurpose of the conversation is set up by the speakerand\nthe speakercan conduct a series of speech acts to pursue\nthe  purpose  which  may  be  clearly  stated  by  her/himor\nhidden.\n[4][5][6]\nWhen a conversation takes place between two or more\npeople,   a   changeat   social   level   will   be   caused.   A\nconversation can be seen as a proper chain of speech acts.\nAs soon asaspeech act is addressed to the addressee, an\nobligation is usually built up for the addresseeto respond.\nOtherwise,  the  addressee  might  not  feel  at  ease.In  a\nsocial   setting,   normsincludingbeliefs,   expectations,\ncommitments, contracts, law and culturegovern people’s\nbehaviorsand determine whether they are acceptable.In\naddition, if a technicalinformation systemis to serve the\norganization   well,itis   crucialto   understand   the\norganizational functions at the social level.\n[4]\nB.The BMM provided byMEASUR\nProposed  in  the  later  1970s,  MEASUR  is  a  radically\nset  ofnormorientedmethods  forISdevelopment.  To\nmodel    business,    MEASUR    providestwoprimary\nmethods:Semantic  Analysis  Method(SAM)and  Norm\nAnalysis Method(NAM).\n[4][7][8]\nOCarefinalresult  ofSAM.Fundamental  concepts\nemployed  by  OC  include  agent,  affordance,ontological\ndependency,determiner,    role,    generic-specific    and\nwhole-part.\nAn agentcan be as simple as anindividualperson and\ncomplex  as  a  cultural  group,  language  community  or\nsociety.An   affordanceis   abehavioran   agent   can\nperform in its environment.OD areused to indicate that\nsomeagents oraffordances(Dependants)can be possible\nonly if certain otheragents oraffordances(Antecedents)\nareavailable.Properties  of  agents  and  affordances  are\nlabeled  as  determiners.  When  an  agent  is  involved  in  a\nbehavior,  it   may  have  a  role  to  play.The  generics\nrepresent  patterns  of  behavioror  mechanisms,  whose\nparticular  realizations  orinstances  are  the  specifics.  A\ncompositeagent   oraffordance(the   whole)can   be\npartitioned into several parts (the part).\nWhen   modeling   an   ontology   chart,   a   society   is\nnormally defined as the root agent, on which other agents\nand  affordances  are  ontologically depended.Agents  are\nplaced in ovals.Affordances are put in rectangular boxes.\nLinesbetween   agentsandaffordances   indicate   OD.\nAntecedents   are   placed   on   the   left   of   dependants.\nDeterminers are  placed  behind  “#”.  Role names are  put\nin half-curves.The specific are placed under the generic.\nA  line  with  a  dot  indicates  the  whole-part  relationship.\nFor   example,   figure   2shows   the   ontological   chart\nillustratinga project managementbusinessas follows:\nInanorganization,  departmentsare  responsible  for\nprojects. Each department and each project has a budget.\nEmployees  workingin  one  departmentcan  be  assigned\nto  different  projects.  Work  activities  are  charged  at  an\nhourly   rate   which   depends   on   the   function   of   the\nemployee.The total time which an employee spends on a\nprojecttask is imputed at the hourly rate.\n[4]\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 20111087\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nFigure 2.The OCdescribinga project managementbusiness\nNorms  arefinalresult  ofNAM.Wright  explains  the\nconcept  of  a  norm  in  this  way:“‘Norm’  has  several\npartial   synonyms   which  are   good   English.   ‘Pattern’,\n‘standard’ and ‘type’ are such words. So are ‘regulation’,\n‘rule’  and  ‘law’”\n[9]\n.Norms  are  developed  through  the\npractical  experiences  of  people  in  a  culture  and  in  turn\nhave functionsof directing, coordinating and controlling\nactions  within  the  culture.In  business,  most  rules  and\nregulations  fall  into  the  category  of  behavioral  norms.\nThesenorms prescribe what people must, may and must\nnot  do,  which  are  equivalent  to  three  deontic  operators\n‘permitted’,  ‘prohibited’  and‘obliged’.

In UML\nAD,  an  activity  staterepresents  the  performance  of  an\nactivity  within  the  process.A  swim  laneindicates  who\nperforms  a  given  activity.A  transition  shows  what  one\nactivity  state  follows  another.  A  decision  with  a  set  of\nguard conditions are defined  to control which transition\nfollows  once  anactivity  is  complete.\n[10]\nFor  example,\nfigure 4 shows the UML activity diagram illustrating the\ngeneralsequence of the actionsinvolved in the business\nuse case “Individual Check-in” in detail.\nFigure 4.The UML activity diagram\n1088JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 2011\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nWhereas   a   business   use-case   model   focuses   on\nsequences  of  actions  involved  in  business  processes,  a\nbusiness   object   model   focusesonbusinessactors,\nbusinessworkers   and   business   entitiesinvolved   in\nbusiness  processesandtheir  relationships.A  business\nworker  represents  a  role  in  abusiness,  which  interacts\nwithbusiness   actors,other   business    workers   and\nmanipulatesbusinessentities.Abusinessentity\nrepresentsasignificantandpersistentpieceof\ninformation  that  is  manipulated  by  business  actors  and\nbusiness  workers.\n[10]\nFor  example,  figure5showsthe\nUMLclass   diagram   illustratingthebusiness   actor\n“Passenger”,thebusiness  worker“Check-in  agent”and\nthebusinessentity“Ticket”,  “Baggage”  and  “Boarding\ncard”involved   in   the   business   use   case   “individual\nCheck-in” and their relationships.\nFigure 5.The UML class diagram\nTomodel  UML  UCD,  UML  AD  and  UML  Class\nDiagrams (CD), corresponding methodscan be found in\n[11-12], which are specified in detail.\nIII.COMPARISONOFTHE TWOBMMS\nPrior  to  the  comparison,  the  relationship  of  the  two\nBMMshave tobe firstly identified.\nAccording  to  the  previous  introduction  of  OC  and\nUML CD, it is quite apparent that both of them are used\nmainly   to   define   meanings   of   terminology   used   in\nbusiness  models.  Therefore,  from view of the  semiotics\nframework, both of themconcern withthe semantics of\nthe framework.\nAlthough purposes incommunications are difficult to\nmodel  by  formal  means,  their  underlying  mechanisms\ncan be understood by studying social and cultural norms\nat   the   social   level.\n[4]\nTherefore,from   view   of   the\nsemiotics   framework,norms   are   the   formal   results\nconcerningwithboththepragmatics andthesocial world\noftheframework.Likewise,purposesin\ncommunications are not modeledformallyand obviously\ninUML  ADeither.  However,  communicationsbetween\nbusiness actors and  business  workersareobviouslyand\nformallyrepresentedinthem, which make theanalysis of\npurposesmuch easier.Moreover,although norms arenot\nspecified   in   UML   AD,business   rules,\n[13]\nwhich   are\nsimilar to norms andgenerallystate that if conditions are\nmet, certain events will happen or actions willbe taken,\nare  hidden  behind  them.For  example,  following  the\nstructure employed in [13],in figure 4,the business rule\nhidden behind the transition pointing to the activity state\n“Deposit baggage” can be explicitly expressed as follows:\niftheticket\niscorrect\nthendeposit baggage\nTo  sum  up,fromview  of  the  semiotics  framework,\nUML  ADconcern  withboththe  pragmatics  andthe\nsocial worldof the framework.\nAt  last,  since  business  use  casesprovide  observable\nvalue  (functions)  tobusiness  actors,according  to  the\nprevious introduction of the social world of the semiotics\nframework, UML UCDconcernwiththe social worldof\nthe framework too.\nTable 1 summarizes the relationship of the two BMMs\nfrom the semiotic framework view.\nTABLE I.\nTHERELATIONSHIPOF THE TWOBMMS\nMEASURRUP\nFormal\nresults\nMethods\nused\nFormal\nresults\nMethodsused\nThe\nsemantics\nOCSAMUML CDUMLCD\nmodeling\nmethod\nThe\npragmatics\nUML ADUMLAD\nmodeling\nmethod\nThe    social\nworld\nNormsNAM\nUML   AD\nandUML\nUCD\nUML   AD   and\nUMLUCD\nmodeling\nmethod\nBased   on   table   1,   thetwoBMMs   can   then   be\ncompared.

In addition,bothUML UCD andUML AD\nare business models employed by the BMM providedby\nRUP,   whichhas  the  similar  modelingactivitiesand\nsequenceas thedevised BMMandismuchwidely used\nthan the BMM provided by MEASUR.At last, although\nbusiness rules rather than norms are specified indirectly\nin  UML  AD,it  is  easy  to  extendUML  ADwith  the\ndeontic operatorstoexpress the same meaningsas norms\nfollowingthesimplerulesspecifiedbelow:\nFirstly,  each  transition  pointing  to  an  activity  state\nshould   be   extended   with   one   of   the   three   deontic\noperators.\nSecondly,when the “permitted” or the “prohibited” is\nused,  the  text  “permitted”  or  the  text  “prohibited”  must\nappear  at  the  end  oftheguard  condition  and  separated\nwith the guard condition by “/”.\nThirdly,when the “obliged” is used, the text “obliged”\ncan be omitted.

However, according to the\nthird rule, the text “obliged” hasbeen omitted.\nMoreover,  following  theformatfor  specification  of\nbehavioral normspreviously introduced,the norm hidden\nbehind   the   transition   pointing   to   the   activity   state\n“Informpreferences”   can   be   explicitly   expressed   as\nfollows:\nwheneverantickethas beenchecked\nifthe ticketiscorrect\nthenthepassenger\nisobliged\ntoinformpreferences\nInaddition,the  norm  hidden  behind  the  transition\npointing  to  the  activity  state  “Deposit  baggage”can  be\nexplicitly expressedas follows:\nwheneverantickethasbeenchecked\nifthe ticket is correct\nthenthe passenger\nispermitted\ntodeposit baggage\nFurthermore,  theusagesof  the“obliged”  and  the\n“permitted”respectivelyin  two  normsalsovalidatethe\nstatement  previously  cited  that:  “with  the  help  of  the\ndeontic operators, norms can handle both business rules\nandexceptions.”\n[13]\nHere,   the   first   norm   handlesa\nbusiness  rule,  which  canalsobe  handled  by  UML  AD\nwithout  the“obliged”extension.  However,  the  second\nnorm handles anexception, which cannot be handled by\nUML AD withoutthe “permitted”extension.\nBecause of the same reason as UMLUCD, theUML\nADmodeling methodwill not be presented here. People\ninterested in it could also find help in [11-12].\nFor  the  sakes  above,theextended  UML  ADare\nchosenas the formal result of the second activity.\nAs  shown  in  table  2,  OD  are  modeled  directly  and\nclearly  in  OC  but  not  defined  in  UML  CD.  Although\nefforts have been devoted into transferring OC into UML\nCD,\n[1-3]\nno simple and mature method has been proposed.\nIn all of the efforts, the transformation of OD hasalways\nbeen the most difficultissue.Therefore, although OC are\nnarrowly   used,in   order   to   keep   theprecise   and\ncompleteness ofbusiness modelsatthe semantics level,\nOCarechosenas the formal result of the third activity.\nReference[4] providesa detailed description of SAM,\nwhich includesfourprimaryphasesto produceOC.The\nfirst phase“problem definition”is for people involved to\nreceivewrittendocuments  to  understand  thebusiness\nproblem.Thenextphase,“candidateaffordance\ngeneration”,   is   to   produce   a   list   of   vocabulary   of\nsemantic  units  that  may  possibly  be  used  inOCto\ndescribe  agents  and  their  patterns  of  behavior.In  the\nfollowingphase “candidate grouping”, the semantic units\narecategorized as agents, affordances, determiners, role\nnames,  and  so  on.  Dependantsareconnected  to  their\nantecedents.Sketches of piecemeal ontological structures\nare   conceived.   Finally,   there   is   “ontology  charting”,\nwhere   a   complete   ontology   chart   isproducedby\nassembling the ontological structures.\n[4]\nFollowingSAMto  complete  the  thirdactivity“OC\nModeling”,extended UML ADderived from the second\nactivity“Extended UML AD Modeling”should be taken\nasadditionalwritten   documents   in   the   first   phase\n“problem  definition”.In  the  second  phase  “candidate\naffordance  generation”,nounsand  verbsused  to  name\nswim lanes and activity statesoftheextended UML AD\ncouldbe considered assemantic units.In the third phase\n“candidate  grouping”,  nouns  used  to  name  swim  lanes\ncould be categorized as agents.Nouns and verbs used to\nname activity states could be categorized as affordances.\nAt last, theperformancesequence of activity statescould\nbe used to determine OD.\nTo  specify  the  practice  of  thestatementabove,  take\nfigure 7 asthe onlywritten document,thesemantic units\nidentifiedshouldinclude“Passenger”, “Check-in Agent”,\n“Show”,    “ticket”,    “Check”,    “Deposit”,    “baggage”,\n“Handle”,   “Inform”,   “preferences”,   “Send”,   “airport\ntravel agency”,  “Print”,“boardingcard”and  “Receive”.\nAt last,theontology chartderivedis shown infigure 8.\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 6, NO. 6, JUNE 20111091\n© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nFigure 8.

Firstly,as  the  same  with both  norms\nand  UML  AD,purposes  in  communicationsare  not\nmodeledformally  and  obviouslyinthe  extended  UML\nADeither.  Secondly,sinceSAM  iscurrentlyusedby\nonly a small group ofISdevelopers, otherISdevelopers\nhave to study SAM beforetheyadoptthe BMMdevised.\nAt last, to validate the BMMdevised,more practices are\nabsolutelyindispensable.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work wassponsored bytheBeijing Philosophy and\nSocial Science Research Center for Beijing\nTransportation Developmentandthe Scientific Research\nFoundation for the ReturnedOverseas Chinese Scholars,\nState Education Ministry.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Z.Xie,  K.Liu,andD.Emmitt,“Improving  Business\nModelling  with  Organisational  Semiotics,”InDynamics\nand Change in Organizations-Studies in Organizational\nSemiotics,  H.W.M.Gazendam,  R.J.Jorna,andR.S.\nCijsonw, Eds.

        "text": "Comparative and critical analysis of organisational culture and national culture in the context of globalisation\n\nThis paper will critically explore the similarities and differences between organisational culture and national culture based on the definitions and formation differences between the two. In detail, this paper will combine Shein's cultural three-layer theory, Hofstede's cultural dimension model and Handy's cultural type theory to critically analyse the applicability and limitations of these models in the context of globalisation and technological change. It will explore the formation and similarities and differences of culture in terms of values, rituals, communication methods and cultural management. A comparative case study of Hewlett-Packard and ITT, as well as Huawei and Google, is used to explore the links and differences between Chinese and Western corporate cultures. The complexity and collective nature of the two cultures is critically discussed, and suggestions and insights for managers in the context of globalisation are proposed.\n\nCulture is a multidimensional concept that is an important factor influencing the behaviour of individuals and groups. It covers different aspects of human behaviour, values and beliefs. By definition, culture can be understood as the collective programming of a social group, which, through learning and continuous intergenerational transmission, influences the behaviour and attitudes of members of an organisation or country (Gudykunst and Kim, 1984). Organizational culture is based on clear individual organizational goals, aims to improve internal collaboration efficiency and external adaptability, and provides value standards, basic beliefs and behavioural norms that members of the organization share. National culture, on the other hand, is a multifaceted and certain reflection of the history, traditions and environment of a regional society, and is the soul of a country and a nation.\n\nOrganizational culture and national culture are highly similar in terms of their core characteristics. Both use similar communication media and methods to shape group behaviour and enhance members' cultural identity. This similarity allows organizations to draw on the management foundations of national culture and adapt them, and also provides a common basis for the dissemination and management of culture. However, it should be noted that this similarity is not completely consistent or unconditional, and there are also deep-seated differences underlying this similarity.\n\nThe core of the values of both organisational culture and national culture is that they share a universal way of thinking and principles that guide the behaviour of members. Schein (1985) proposed in the ‘values’ layer of the three-layer theory of culture in organisations and leadership that the established philosophies and values shared within an organisation also influence the behaviour patterns of members through norms, such as corporate rules and regulations. The values mentioned in national culture tend to be a set of social norms. They are the specific behavioural patterns and shared value standards formed during long-term social activities in a specific social environment to meet the needs of people living together in good order. They are an important part of the social order and code of conduct of a country, and also correct the behavioural patterns of residents through social customs and laws. The influence of national culture on organisational culture is significant. It indirectly shapes organisational culture by influencing management decisions, leadership styles and human resources management models (Khan et al., 2017). For example, in Hewlett-Packard (HP), the culture of collaboration and trust under the organisation to a certain extent reflects the individualistic and innovative values of American culture. For example, HP embodies the individual freedom and creativity emphasised in American culture through open corporate communication and informal communication environments such as ‘beer parties’ and ‘coffee exchanges’ (Morgan, 2006). Under Hofstede's cultural dimension model, the US's ‘low power distance’ and ‘high individualism’ are precisely the foundation of HP's culture.\n\nThe symbolic nature of rituals plays an important role in both organisational culture and national culture. It is a non-verbal cultural expression that conveys cultural messages through symbols and actions (Bayer et al., 1987). Schein (1985) points out in his ‘artifact’ layer that visible symbols and behaviours within organisational culture can reinforce the core values of the organisation. In Handy's cultural type model, its ‘role culture’ and ‘task culture’ are often expressed through rituals. For example, task culture-oriented organisations use team meetings and project kick-off ceremonies to establish a sense of identity with the organisation among members. Bayer (1987) divides organisational culture rituals into four categories: integration, reinforcement, degradation and transition, which consolidate and express culture through different functions. Similarly, the rituals in national culture carry the national will, national spirit and beliefs of the people. They express the national cultural traditions, historical memories, political beliefs and national emotions through rituals (Duan et al., 2023). For example, the Chinese New Year symbolises the harmony and stability of society and conveys core values through reunions and parties. Rituals in both cultures have the task of arousing the emotions and identity of members or citizens, while maintaining and constructing power or social order and strengthening identity (Berberovic, 2015).\n\nStorytelling is an important means of disseminating core values in organisational and national cultures. Shein's deep-seated hypothesis states that the values in organisational culture are often conveyed through brand stories, which help members understand the brand culture, history and goals, and enhance overall cohesion and a sense of identity. This is similar to the role of mythological stories and historical hero stories in national culture, which can enhance national cultural confidence and international influence (Orme, 2012). For example, HP's story of ‘garage entrepreneurship’ has strengthened the company's spirit of innovation and open source, inspiring employees and conveying the company's cultural values. In national culture, the ‘American Dream’ is a proper noun that interprets the American ideal of life and is rooted in the Declaration of Independence, inspiring countless members of society to pursue personal freedom and dreams.\n\nSimilarly, the scope and depth of the influence of organisational culture and national culture differ, creating a huge difference between the two cultures. The reason for this is mainly that organisational culture is mainly focused on achieving specific organisational goals, such as specific business goals. In contrast, national culture emphasises the shaping of group behaviour by history, tradition and social environment. For example, collectivism in Japanese culture originates from Confucianism, emphasising the division of labour and harmonious development of different parts of society. Such values are not just about achieving specific goals, but the result of a long period of historical accumulation. It is worth mentioning that the goal-oriented nature of organisational culture makes it easier for managers to intervene, while national culture has a higher degree of stability. However, such a social framework often shows insufficient adaptability in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nFirst of all, the values in an organisational culture are also influenced by the internal socialisation process of the organisation, resulting in some differences. Nelson (2003) found that organisational culture systematically reproduces national values while also rejecting some of them. He calls this phenomenon the ‘assimilation’ and ‘rejection’ responses in culture, and uses the United States, India and Brazil as examples. The culture of some non-profit organisations in the United States rejects the capitalist logic and highly individualistic values of the United States, and instead pursues collectivism and teamwork. In India, some organisational cultures reject the traditional hierarchical culture. This is particularly evident in some technology-driven multinational companies, which have adopted Western management styles and pursue equality and open communication. In Brazil, some entrepreneurial technology start-ups reject the traditional patriarchal and bureaucratic nature of the national culture when establishing their organisational culture, emphasising flexibility and innovation. In summary, it is found that, especially when emerging enterprises establish an organisational culture, they pay attention to the adaptation of the purpose of the organisation itself and a process of eliminating the inferior and retaining the superior in the national culture.\n\nSecond, the rituals in national culture place more emphasis on the continuation of national history and culture, while the organisational culture places more emphasis on corporate management and employee development. For example, in the protection of intangible cultural heritage, there has been an emphasis on ‘upholding tradition and innovation’, which means that innovation must be based on maintaining tradition, while organisational culture tends to cater to the development of modern technology and social media and keep up with the times (Peng, 2023). In addition, the rituals of national culture construct and strengthen people's national identity through symbols and representations. For example, political rituals connect the connotation of the nation with the five senses by recreating historical scenes, awakening collective memory, and strengthening identity, thus constructing the logical line of national identity (Ma, 2019). Moreover, they involve broader social dimensions such as political legitimacy and moral identity. The symbolic system of organisational culture focuses more on the emotional stimulation of members, such as the recognition of outstanding employees and the announcement of promotions. Such strengthening and transitional rituals help members understand the essence and intrinsic value of the organisation through rituals.\n\nIn addition, the stories of national culture usually involve national history, politics and social change, and may also reflect cultural dimensions such as power distance and individualism versus collectivism (Khan 2017). By awakening national memory and emphasising a universal heroism, it can directly influence both the collective and the individual. For example, in the famous Danish rescue operation during World War II, German official Georg chose to protect Jews from Nazi persecution, advocating the value of respecting life. The stories in the organisational culture focus more on specific values and behaviour patterns within the organisation, and more on personal heroism, guiding members to admire them. The stories convey concepts and attitudes from narrative to knowledge sharing, emotional resonance, vision and ideals, and dedication, guiding employees to align with collective values and maintain passion for collective work at all times (Güney, 2023).\n\nMore importantly, national cultures usually evolve slowly, as they are shaped by national history, traditions and social circumstances. In contrast, organisational cultures are goal-oriented and require rapid adaptation to market changes. However, in Shein's organisational culture model, the ‘artifact’ and ‘values’ layers are more susceptible to market and technological changes, while changes in deep assumptions are relatively slow. This difference in the speed of change at these levels also brings greater flexibility to the organisational culture (Nergui, 2012). Hosfstede's ‘power distance’ dimension can be found to be stable over time in different countries. For example, the hierarchical structure of France is determined by its high power distance, and this characteristic still dominates social interactions despite the impact of globalisation.\n\nTherefore, we can draw some insights from the management of globalisation here. Since globalisation and technological progress are reshaping culture and its boundaries, culture is dynamic and diverse. Managers should adopt more flexible strategies to adapt to changes. For example, telecommuting in the era of the pandemic has changed traditional cultural symbols such as office design, and digital tools have also become new cultural media.\n\nIn general, there are significant similarities between organisational culture and national culture in terms of values, communication media and tools. However, due to different goal orientations, there are also obvious differences. Managers should collaborate more to establish common values and a communication framework that brings management value to the enterprise. They should also explore cultural collaboration in a multicultural environment more to improve organisational effectiveness in a global context.\n\nReferences：\n\nAlexander, J.W. & Morgan, G.

Organizational culture is based on precise individual and organizational goals, aims to improve internal collaboration efficiency and external adaptability, and provides value standards, fundamental beliefs, and behavioral norms that members of the organization share. National culture, on the other hand, is a multifaceted and specific reflection of the history, traditions, and environment of a regional society and is the soul of a country and a nation.\n\nOrganizational culture and national culture are highly similar in terms of their core characteristics. Both use similar communication media and methods to shape group behaviour and enhance members' cultural identity. This similarity allows organizations to draw on and adapt the management foundations of national culture, and it also provides an everyday basis for the dissemination and management of culture. However, it should be noted that this similarity is not entirely consistent or unconditional, and there are also deep-seated differences underlying this similarity.\n\nThe core values of both organizational culture and national culture are that they share a universal way of thinking and principles that guide the behavior of members.

Last paragraph of INTRODUCTION.\" 这里有几个结构方面需要考虑：定义博客、现有研究现状和当前研究的问题。\n\n在学生提供的中文答案中，结构部分分为三个主要部分：“Definition of Blogging”, “Shortcomings of Existing Research”，“Motivation and Value of Current Research”。“Definition of Blogging”部分提到了 blogging的起源和基本功能，这部分看起来很清晰。然后是“Shortcomings of Existing Research”，说明现有的研究在应用方面比较有限，并指出国际化的沟通不足，这确实是一个重要的点，但可能没有涵盖所有相关领域，比如国内研究进展不够全面。\n\n接下来，学生提到内容部分需要基于Accredited文献、相关领域的现有研究，以及几个具体部分：ISN作为现代商务工具的重要性，Skilled workforcegap的影响， Certification作为一种测量ISN专业能力的工具。这部分内容很充实，但可能需要更详细地结合实际案例和数据支持。\n\n在结构部分，学生将三个主要问题细化到子标题下，每个子标题都有详细的讨论。例如，在“Importance of ISN as a Business Communication Tool”中，他们提供了大量的数据和案例来支持论点，并且还提到“Hiring trends and Salary Levels in the ISN Industry”，这可能是一个很好的例子。\n\n总的来说，学生的答案在结构上比较清晰，覆盖了必要的部分，但可以更详细地结合实际案例、数据和文献来源，这样会更有说服力。同时，在讨论现有研究时，学生提到了国际化的沟通不足，这部分是重要的，但可能需要进一步扩展到国内的情况。\n\n还有，原文中的“Insufficient part”可能不够明确，学生提到的“fewer applied researches in internationalized communication”可能可以更具体地指出有哪些具体的领域的应用研究不足。而“The Role of Certification”部分，学生的分析比较全面，但可能需要更多的实际案例来支持这些观点。\n\n另外，在内容部分，除了理论上的支撑外，是否需要包括一些实践层面的建议或数据结果？比如，学生提到的“Hiring trends and Salary Levels in the ISN Industry”，这可能是一个很好的例子，可以作为结论的一部分，说明当前研究的意义和价值。\n\n最后，结构方面，“The Importance of ISN as a Business Communication Tool”中的具体案例是否足够多样？或者是否有更多的文献支持这一观点？同样地，在“The Role of Certification”部分，是否需要更详细的数据或案例来支撑其作用？\n\n总结一下，学生的答案在结构上比较完整，涵盖了必要的内容和子部分，但可能可以进一步结合实际数据、案例，并更详细地阐述现有研究的不足。此外，对于现有的理论支持部分，可以包括更多的文献引用，并指出这些文献的具体应用情况。\n</think>\n\n学生提供的中文回答与原题对照如下：\n\n**中文答案：**\n\n**Case 2: The Value of Certification Position (The purposes of literature review)**\n  \nPosition (The purposes of literature review):  \nThe purpose of the literature review is to systematically analyze existing research on blogs in Chinese cultural dissemination. It will cover the definition of blogs, their characteristics, potential as communication tools, and current applications, while also identifying gaps and outlining the motivation for developing an English blog system.\n\n**Content:**\nThe content is based on existing literature, citing the definition of blogs and their background in education, scientific research, and other fields. It focuses on describing the basic functional characteristics and potential value of blogs without delving into specific case studies or evaluation of cultural effects. The insufficient part mentions fewer applied researches in internationalized communication, which indirectly reflects current research needs but fails to comprehensively cover related progress.\n\n**Structure:**\nOrganized under clear headings:\n1. **Definition of Blogging**: Explains the origin and basic functions of blogging.\n2. **Shortcomings of Existing Research**: Points out limited studies on blogs' application in Chinese cultural communication, noting the lack of internationalized research.\n3. **Motivation and Value of Current Research**: Clarifies the motivation to develop the English blog system and its value.\n\n**Organization by Key Areas:**\n1. **Importance of ISN as a Business Communication Tool**: Utilizes data and case studies (e.g., hiring trends, compensation levels) to illustrate the irreplaceability of ISN in corporate communication.\n2. **The Challenge of the Skills Shortage**: Discusses the skill gap affecting recruitment processes.\n3. **The Role of Certification**: Analyzes certification's impact on recruitment and compensation, forming a foundation for the study.\n4. **The Content, Motivation, and Value of Current Research**: Supported by detailed discussions and literature with examples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n结构部分较为清晰，覆盖了必要内容和子标题，但可以进一步结合实际案例、数据和文献来源，并更详细地阐述现有研究的不足。此外，对于理论支撑部分可包括更多的具体支持和文献引用，以增强说服力。\n\n**总结：**\n学生的回答在结构上完整，涵盖了必要的内容和子部分，但可能可以进一步结合实际数据、案例，并更详细地阐述现有研究的不足。此外，理论支撑部分可包括更多具体的支持和文献引用，以增强说服力。",
